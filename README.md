# About

This project contains a simple code sharing platform. The app assumes the first user is an observer, where every subsequent user is a contribuiter. The first user therefore has only reading access while the others have writing access to each code snippet. The code snippets are premade, though editing them is persistant between uses.
Possible extensions to it are:
- Adding session management.
- Building a seperate server as middleware, to seperate db and access points (to enable less strict access to server).
- Adding authentication, social info, etc.

# Available Scripts

# Notes

 This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and empowered by the generous support of human and non-human friends.
